This project aims to leverage the machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machine, enabling proactive prediction and mitigation of various types of employee attritions based on various factors.

Based on the model performance:
Logistic Regression - Achieved the highest accuracy of 89%, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing linear relationships within the dataset.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Followed closely with an accuracy of 87%, showing strong performance in handling complex relationships in the data.
Decision Tree - Achieved an accuracy of 78%, indicating potential overfitting or limitations in capturing the dataset's underlying patterns.

Dataset used is from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
