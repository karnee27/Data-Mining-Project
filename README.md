This project aims to leverage the machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machine, enabling proactive prediction and mitigation of various types of employee attritions based on various factors.

Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 89%, effectively capturing linear relationships in the dataset. SVM closely followed with an accuracy of 87%, demonstrating its strength in handling complex data patterns. Meanwhile, the Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 78%, which suggests potential overfitting or limitations in capturing the dataset's underlying structure. 

Dataset used is from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
